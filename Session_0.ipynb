    "    - It has been used for many famous things that you use in your day to day life such as Reddit, YouTube, Wikipedia, and many other things \n",
    "- Why use a programming language like Python? \n",
    "    - Computers work with 1's and 0's (binary) and we need something to bridge this gap between human language such as English and machine language; that's where programming languages like Python come into the picture \n",
    "    - Code that you write in Python is coverted to machine code that can be understood by the computer; no one wants to write in 1's and 0s to tell the computer what to do "
